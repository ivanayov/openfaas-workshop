# Lab 7 - Put it all together

<img src="https://github.com/openfaas/media/raw/master/OpenFaaS_Magnet_3_1_png.png" width="500px"></img>

We're going to create a GitHub bot with OpenFaaS functions named `issue-bot`.

The job of issue-bot is to triage new issues by analysing the sentiment of the "description" field, it will then apply a label of *positive* or *review*. This will help the maintainers with their busy schedule so they can prioritize which issues to look at first.

## Get a GitHub account

* Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you do not already have one.

* Create a new repository and call it *bot-tester*

Note: we will only use this repository as a testing ground for creating Issues. You don't need to commit any code there.

## Set up a tunnel with ngrok

You will need to receive incoming webhooks from GitHub. In production you will have a clear route for incoming traffic but within the constraints of a workshop we have to be creative.

Run this on your local computer:

```
$ docker run -p 4040:127.0.0.1:4040 -it --rm --net=func_functions \
  stefanprodan/ngrok http gateway:8080
```

You will be given a URL that you can access over the Internet, it will connect directly to your OpenFaaS API Gateway.

Test the URL such as http://fuh83fhfj.ngrok.io

```
$ faas-cli list --gateway http://fuh83fhfj.ngrok.io/
```

## Create an webhook receiver `issue-bot`

```
$ faas new --lang python issue-bot --prefix="<your-docker-username-here>"
$ faas build -f ./issue-bot.yml
$ faas push -f ./issue-bot.yml
```

Now edit the function's YAML file `issue-bot.yml` and add an environmental variable of `write_debug: true`:

```
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://localhost:8080

functions:
  issue-bot:
    lang: python
    handler: ./issue-bot
    image: <user-name>/issue-bot
    environment:
      write_debug: true
```

* Deploy the function

```
$ faas deploy -f ./issue-bot.yml
```

## Receive webhooks from GitHub

Log back into GitHub and navigate to your repository *bot-tester*

Click *Settings* -> *Webhooks* -> *Add Webhook*

Now enter the URL you were given from Ngrok adding `/function/issue-bot` to the end, for example:

```
http://fuh83fhfj.ngrok.io/function/issue-bot
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyovcheva/github-issue-bot/master/media/WebhookURLSettings.png)

For *Content-type* select : application/json

Leave *Secret* blank for now.

And select "Send me everything"

For events select **Issues** and **Issue comment**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyovcheva/github-issue-bot/master/media/WebhookEventsSettings.png)

## Check it worked

Now go to GitHub and create a new issue. Type "test" for the title and description.

Check how many times the function has been called:

```
$ faas list
Function    Invocations
issue-bot   1
```

Each time you create an issue the count will increase due to GitHub's API invoking the function.

You can see the payload sent via GitHub by typing in `docker service logs -f issue-bot`.

The GitHub Webhooks page will also show every message sent under "Recent Deliveries", you can replay a message here and see the response returned by your function.

## Analyse new Issues on GitHub


### Deploy SentimentAnalysis function

In order to use this issue-bot function, you will need to deploy the SentimentAnalysis function first.
This is a python function that provides a rating on sentiment positive/negative (polarity -1.0-1.0) and subjectivity provided to each of the sentences sent in via the TextBlob project.

You can deploy it from the **Function Store**

and test

```
# echo -n "I am really excited to participate in the OpenFaaS workshop." | faas-cli invoke sentimentanalysis
Polarity: 0.375 Subjectivity: 0.75

# echo -n "The hotel was clean, but the area was terrible" | faas-cli invoke sentimentanalysis
Polarity: -0.316666666667 Subjectivity: 0.85
```

### Create `issue-bot` function

Create `issue-bot` function with

```
faas-cli new --lang python issue-bot
```

Then open `issue-bot/handler.py` and paste this code:

```
import requests, json, os, sys

def handle(req):

    event_header = os.getenv("Http_X_Github_Event")

    if not event_header == "issues":
        sys.exit(1)
        return

    gateway_hostname = os.getenv("gateway_hostname", "gateway")

    payload = json.loads(req)

    if not payload["action"] == "opened":
        return

    #sentimentanalysis
    res = requests.post('http://' + gateway_hostname + ':8080/function/sentimentanalysis', data=payload["issue"]["title"]+" "+payload["issue"]["body"])

    print(res.json())
```

Update `requirements.txt` with 

```
requests
```

This is the key line for chaining functions:

```
res = requests.post('http://' + gateway_hostname + ':8080/function/sentimentanalysis', data=payload["issue"]["title"]+" "+payload["issue"]["body"])
```

What you do here is to post the data to the already deployed `sentimentanalysis` function, which will read it and return the results.

### Build and Deploy:

Use the CLI to build and deploy the function:

```
$ faas build -f issue-bot.yml \
  && faas push -f issue-bot.yml \
  && faas deploy -f issue-bot.yml
```

Now create a new issue in the `bot-tester` repo.

Then go to Settings -> Webhook and check the response from the event.

## Apply labels via the GitHub API

### Create a Personal Access Token for GitHub

Go to your GitHub profile -> Settings/Developer settings/Personal access tokens and generate new token.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyovcheva/github-issue-bot/master/media/PersonalAccessTokens.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyovcheva/github-issue-bot/master/media/NewPAT.png)

Copy the contents of `env.example.yml` to `env.yml` and update `auth_token` value with the new generated token.

Update `repo` in `env.yml` with the `bot-tester` repository.

### Update code

Open `issue-bot/handler.py` and update the code with:

```
from github import Github

# ... leave the old code here

# positive_threshold
    positive_threshold = float(os.getenv("positive_threshold", "0.2"))

    g = Github(os.getenv("auth_token"))
    repo = g.get_repo(os.getenv("repo"))
    issue = repo.get_issue(payload["issue"]["number"])

    has_label_positive = False
    has_label_review = False
    for label in issue.labels:
        if label == "positive":
            has_label_positive = True
        if label == "review":
            has_label_review = True

    if res.json()['polarity']  >  positive_threshold and not has_label_positive:
        issue.set_labels("positive")
    elif not has_label_review:
        issue.set_labels("review")

    print(res.json())
```

Here we use a non official Python library for GitHUb - [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub), which appears to be the most popular between any alternatives.


In order the use the library update `requirements.txt` with 

```
PyGithub
```

### Build and Deploy:

Use the CLI to build and deploy the function:

```
$ faas build -f issue-bot.yml \
  && faas push -f issue-bot.yml \
  && faas deploy -f issue-bot.yml
```

Now create new issues in the `bot-tester` repo and type different possitive and negative statements in the issue body.

Check whether `possitive` and `review` labels were properly applied.


Now return to the [main page for Q&A](./README.md).
